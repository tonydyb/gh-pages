Option 1: nohup
The best way is often the simplest.

nohup long-running-command &
It was made specifically for this, it even logs stdout to nohup.log.

man nohup
Option 2: bg
If you want to "background" some already running tasks, then your best bet is to Ctrl+Z then run

bg
to put your most recent suspended task to background, allowing it to continue running.

Then a quick disown should keep the process running after you log out.

screen and others can do it, but that's not what they're for. I recommend nohup for tasks you know your going to leave behind and bg for tasks your already running and don't want to re-start.

Keep in mind, both are bash specific. If you're not using bash, then the commands could be different.
